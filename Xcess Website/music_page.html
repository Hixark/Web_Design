                <h3>Song Lyrics</h3>
                <p>[Intro]<br>
                    And they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
                    They wishin' on me, yuh<br>

                    [Verse 1]<br>
                    I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
                    Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
                    Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
                    You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
                    I don't wanna die for them to miss me
                    Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
                    Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
                    They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

                    [Chorus]<br>
                    God's plan, God's plan
                    I hold back, sometimes I won't, yuh
                    I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
                    I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
                    Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait
                    I go hard on Southside G, yuh, wait
                    I make sure that north-side eat

                    [Post-Chorus]<br>
                    And still, bad things
                    It's a lot of bad things
                    That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
                    They wishin' on me
                    Bad things
                    It's a lot of bad things
                    That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
                    They wishin' on me
                    Yuh, ayy, ayy<br>

                    [Verse 2]<br>
                    She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly
                    I only love my bed and my mama, I'm sorry"
                    Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
                    81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
                    And you know me
                    Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
                    Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
                    'Magine if I never met the broskies<br>

                    [Chorus]<br>
                    God's plan, God's plan
                    I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
                    Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close
                    I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy
                    Might go down as G.O.D., yeah, wait
                    I go hard on Southside G, ayy, wait
                    I make sure that north-side eat, yuh<br>

                    [Post-Chorus]<br>
                    And still, bad things
                    It's a lot of bad things
                    That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
                    They wishin' on me, yeah, yeah
                    Bad things
                    It's a lot of bad things
                    That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
                    They wishin' on me, yeah</p>
